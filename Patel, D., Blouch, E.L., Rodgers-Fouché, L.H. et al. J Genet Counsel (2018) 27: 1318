Title: Finding a Balance: Reconciling the Needs of the Institution, Patient, and Genetic Counselor for Optimal Resource Utilization

Abstract: The current practice of cancer genetic counseling is undergoing widespread change and scrutiny. While there are clinical resources for genetic counselors (GCs) regarding the delivery of cancer genetic services, there is limited literature regarding effective management of a genetic counseling clinical program. We have developed administrative tools to manage a large team of GCs at a single academic medical center over a period of increasing demand for genetics services, with the initial aim of decreasing wait time for urgent genetic counseling visits. Here, we describe the three main elements of the clinical operations: Balancing patient volume between GCs, scheduling tracks for both routine and urgent appointments, and a team of triaging GCs to ensure appropriate patient referrals. For each of these elements, we describe how they have been modified over time and present data to support the utility of these strategies. The preliminary evidence offered here suggests that these tools allow for an equitable distribution of patient volume between team members, as well as the timely and accurate scheduling of urgent patients. As a result of the experiences presented here, other genetic counseling programs grappling with similar issues should be aware that it is possible to shift clinical operations to serve certain patient populations in a more timely fashion while keeping both providers and GC staff satisfied.

Notes:

This article describes the system that Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Cancer Risk Assessment (CCRA) established to distribute incoming patients across their team of genetic counselors and the improvements made to handle the increase in volume of patients they have experienced. The goal of these improvements was to decrease patient wait time while maintaining genetic counselor's job satisfaction. The authors identified three main elements of their operation: "balancing patient volume between GCs, scheduling tracks for both routine and urgent appointments, and a team of triaging GCs to ensure appropriate patient referrals".

To balance patient volume between GCs, a "balance board" was created where GCs track the number of patients they are seeing each day and assign urgent patients based on work load. Improvements were made to adjust for monthly patient volume, planned and unplanned time off, and expected changes in the number of urgent referrals. 

In order to properly accommodate patients scheduled in advance and those in urgent need of care, a scheduling system that differentiated patients based on urgency was created. To ensure urgent patients would not unexpectedly overload GCs' schedules, 20% of appointments were reversed for urgent care. Revisions were made to anticipate days that would have a high number of urgent requests and schedule fewer routine appointments during such times. 

In respond to the higher number or urgent requests, they developed the "Genetic Counselor on Page" (GCOP) system. In this system, one GC is designated as the GCOP to handle patient triaging, assist with scheduling, and balancing the workload to GCs on the balance board. While this was initially a round-robin system, that proved too chaotic and it was changed to rotating between only three GCs. To compensate for the responsibility these GCs received a reduction in patient volume. 

The efforts described were reported as being effective in distributing patients in a timely fashion, maintaining or improving GC satisfaction, as well as referring physician satisfaction. The authors call for more research into radical changes to the GC model to explore alternative practices.
